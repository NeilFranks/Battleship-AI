More intelligent sampling:
    a) change the sampling scheme to just generate legal board configs with respect to the observed portions of the board
    b) Implement particle reinvigoration
        i) the same approach as paper
        ii) randomly sample over the board configs at some point and add some new particles to the particle set.
        iii) while adding new particles, generate particles that are valid with respect to the observed board configs.
    c) Preferred action implement!
